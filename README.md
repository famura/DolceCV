# Dolche CV
A LaTeX-based, yet nice, template for your curriculum vita based on [Friggeri CV template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/friggeri-cv-template/hmnchbfmjgqh).
I added some commands, simplified things, changed colors, and adapted the layout.
So, feel free to modify according to your needs, e.g. add and remove categories.

# Suggestions / Adivces
- Try to keep it all on one page, especially if you are still a bachelor, master or PhD student.
- Please don't be the person that adds travel grants to awards, that's just embarssing.
- Don't forget to enter your name and ID for accounts like Google Scholar or GitHub.

# Trivia
Yes, the color are familiar to you. It's the "tab10" color palette from seaborn :D
